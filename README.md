2. Follow each section below step-by-step.

---

## Docker Basics

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications inside containers.

---

## Docker Architecture

- **Docker Client**: CLI tool to interact with Docker daemon.  
- **Docker Daemon**: Background service managing containers.  
- **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.  
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.  
- **Docker Hub**: Public repository to share images.

---

## Essential Docker Commands

| Command               | Description                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `docker --version`    | Check Docker version                      |
| `docker pull <image>` | Download an image from Docker Hub        |
| `docker run <image>`  | Run a container from an image             |
| `docker ps`           | List running containers                   |
| `docker ps -a`        | List all containers (running & stopped)  |
| `docker stop <id>`    | Stop a running container                   |
| `docker rm <id>`      | Remove a container                         |
| `docker rmi <image>`  | Remove an image                            |
| `docker build .`      | Build image from Dockerfile                |
| `docker logs <id>`    | View logs of a container                   |

---

## Docker Images & Containers

- Images are built using **Dockerfile**, a text file with instructions.  
- Containers are launched from images, isolated from the host OS.  
- Images are immutable; containers are mutable and can be stopped, started, or deleted.

---

## Dockerfile Basics

Create a file named `Dockerfile` to define your image:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy local files to container
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


---

---

## Building a Basic Pipeline

- **Source Code Management (SCM)**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
- **Build Stage**: Compile code, package artifacts  
- **Test Stage**: Unit tests, integration tests, linting  
- **Deploy Stage**: Deploy to staging or production environment  

---

## Pipeline Components Explained

### Build

- Compile code  
- Install dependencies  
- Generate build artifacts

### Test

- Run unit tests  
- Run integration and end-to-end tests  
- Static code analysis

### Deploy

- Deploy to test/staging environment  
- Manual or automatic promotion to production  
- Rollback on failure

---

## Pipeline as Code

- Define pipeline configurations as code files in your repo (e.g., Jenkinsfile, `.github/workflows/*.yml`).  
- Benefits: version control, peer review, and reproducibility.

---

## Example: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- Create `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploy steps go here"

## ☸️ Kubernetes Core Concepts

### 🧱 Basic Resources

- **Pod** – Smallest deployable unit (1 or more containers)
- **Service** – Exposes a set of pods via DNS or IP
- **Deployment** – Declaratively manages replica sets
- **Namespace** – Logical separation inside a cluster

📄 Examples:
```yaml
# deployments.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

---

## ⚙️ Kubernetes Advanced Features

- **ConfigMap & Secret** – Externalize configuration & sensitive data
- **Ingress Controller** – Manage external access to services
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** – Automatically scales pods

📄 Examples:
```yaml
# hpa.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: nginx-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 50
```

## ✅ Best Practices

📄 `docs/best-practices.md`

```markdown
# Kubernetes & Monitoring Best Practices

- Use `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` for all services
- Set resource limits and requests for every pod
- Avoid running apps as root
- Use namespaces for environments (dev/stage/prod)
- Version your Helm charts or manifests
- Use Prometheus alert rules with Alertmanager
